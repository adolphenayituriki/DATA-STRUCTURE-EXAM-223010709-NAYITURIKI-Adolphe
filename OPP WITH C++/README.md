EXAMPLE1: This C++ program is a simple introduction to basic syntax. I include the `<iostream>` library to enable input and output operations, such as printing text to the screen. By using `namespace std`, I avoid having to prefix standard functions like `cout` with `std::`, making the code cleaner. The `main()` function is the entry point of the program, and inside it, I use `cout` to print a message: `"Hello, World! Am called Adolphe Nayituriki."` to the screen. Finally, `return 0;` indicates that the program executed successfully without errors.

EXAMPLE 2: I define variables to store an integer (age), a double (price), a character (grade), and a string (name). Then, I use cout to print these values, demonstrating how variables hold and display information. I use endl to format the output properly by moving to a new line after each statement. Finally, return 0; ensures the program runs successfully.

EXAMPLE 3: It allows the user to enter their name and age, storing the values in variables by using "cin". The program then outputs a personalized message using the provided input. This demonstrates how to interact with users and handle basic input and output operations effectively.

EXAMPLE 4: I demonstrate how arithmetic operators work in C++. I start by declaring two integer variables, a and b, with values 12 and 4. Then, I use the + operator to calculate their sum, - for the difference, * for the product, / for the quotient, and % to get the remainder of their division. Each result is displayed using cout, showing how these operators perform mathematical calculations.

EXAMPLE 5: I use an if statement to check a person's age and determine their category. If the age is 18 or older, it prints "You are an adult." If the age is 60 or above, it should classify the person as a senior citizen, but since the return 0; is inside the first condition, the program exits early and never checks for seniors. If the age is below 18, it prints "You are a minor." This program demonstrates decision-making using conditional statements in C++.

EXAMPLE 6: I use a for loop to repeat a block of code multiple times. The loop starts with i = 1 and runs until i reaches 8, increasing by 1 each time. Inside the loop, I print the current iteration number using cout. This demonstrates how loops can be used to automate repetitive tasks efficiently in C++. Finally, return 0; ensures successful program execution.


EXAMPLE 7: In this program, I use a while loop to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition remains true. I start by initializing i = 1, and the loop runs while i is less than or equal to 5. Inside the loop, I print the current iteration number and then increment i by 1 to ensure the loop progresses. This demonstrates how while loops are useful for executing tasks when the number of iterations isn't predetermined.

EXAMPLE 8:  I use a do-while loop to execute a block of code at least once before checking the condition. I initialize i = 1, then print the iteration number and increment i inside the loop. After executing the block, the condition i <= 5 is checked; if true, the loop runs again. This ensures the code inside the loop executes at least once, making do-while loops useful when I want the loop to run before validating a condition.

EXAMPLE 9:  I create a function named add that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum. In main(), I call this function with arguments 8 and 7, storing the result in the sum variable. Then, I print the sum using cout. This demonstrates how functions help in organizing code, making it reusable and modular.


EXAMPLE 10: I define a function named greet with a void return type, meaning it does not return a value. It takes a string parameter, name, and prints a greeting message. In main(), I call greet("Alice") to display "Hello, Alice!". This shows how functions with a void return type are useful for executing tasks without needing to return a result.
