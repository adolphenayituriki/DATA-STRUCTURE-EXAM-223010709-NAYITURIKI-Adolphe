EXAMPLE1: First, this C++ program has a simple introduction to basic syntax. I include the `<iostream>` library to allow me to input and output things. iostream enable input and output operations, such as printing text to the screen. By using `namespace std`, I avoid having to prefix standard functions like `cout` with `std::`, making the code cleaner. The `main()` function is the entry point of the program, and inside it, I use `cout` to print a message: `"Hello, World! Am called Adolphe Nayituriki."` to the screen. Finally, `return 0;` indicates that the program executed successfully without errors.

On example EXAMPLE 2, I define variables to store an integer(as datatype) with a variable(age), a double(datatype) with a variable(price), a character(char datatype) with a variable(grade), and a string(datatype) with a variable(name). Then, I use cout to print these values, Representing how variables hold and display information. I use endl to format the output properly by moving to a new line after each statement. Finally, return 0; ensures the program runs successfully.

On EXAMPLE 3, I allows the user to enter their name and age, storing the values in variables by using "cin". The program then outputs a personalized message using the provided input. This shows how to interact with users and handle basic input and output operations effectively.

And after for EXAMPLE 4, I Determine how arithmetic operators work in C++. I start by declaring two integer variables, a and b, with values 12 and 4. Then, I use the + operator to calculate their sum, - for the difference, * for the product, / for the quotient, and % to get the remainder of their division. Each result is displayed using cout, showing how these operators perform mathematical calculations.
